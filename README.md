# Introduction
This repository contains the following:
  * This ReadMe file
  * Collatz.py which is the original plain single integer Collatz Conjecture test
  * Collatz_Range.py which tests each integer from 2 up, in sequence to return:
    * The integer tested
    * The number of iterations it took to test
    * The time it took to test

# What is the Collatz Conjecture?
The Collatz Conjecture implies that for each positive integer n, given the following binary calculation, the resultant integer will always be 1 with the calculations as follows:

If n is even then divide by 2

If n is odd then multiply by 3 and then add 1

Currently this Conjecture has not been proven for all positive integers.
